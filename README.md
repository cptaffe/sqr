squaresum
=========

Calculates the square of a number as a series of differences of squares.

## Resoning

This program is not very efficient nor useful, but it is a delve into using some very simple but interesting mathematics.

## Systems

Debian Linux (Jessie/testing) and OS X (Darwin) are the only tested platforms. Weak points for portability are man directory location and library functions.

## Usage

```
usage: ./sqr [num] [-i | --iterative | -r | --recursive]
```

The `--iterative` flag uses the iterative function, wheras the `--recursive` flag uses the recursive method. They have shorthand flags of `-i` and `-r` respectively.

## Performance

The recursive method is both much slower on larger numbers and will segfault as it runs out of stack space. As such, the iterative method is default and is both much faster and takes up minimal stack space.

## Math

```
f: x -> x^2

f(x + 1) - x^2 = 2x + 1

the sum from i=1 to n of 2(i - 1) + 1 = n^2
```

Proof by induction:
```
k = 1: 2(0) + 1 = 1
k = 2: 2(0) + 1 + 2(1) + 1 = 4
k + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3: 2(0) + 1 + 2(1) + 1 + 2(2) + 1 = 9
```
