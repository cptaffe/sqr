.SH NAME
sqr \-- square a number

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsqr\fR num <args>

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsqr\fR squares a given number, \fBnum\fR, by summing the sequence of squares from 1 to num.

A square, plus two times its root, plus 1 is the square of the next integer. This has been programmed both iteratively and recursively. The iterative method is default, but chosen by supplying these arguments:
.TP
[\fB-i\fR | \fB--iterative\fR]
iterative calculation
.TP
[\fB-r\fR | \fB--recursive\fR]
